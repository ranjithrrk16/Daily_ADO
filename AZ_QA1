🚀 Azure DevOps Engineer (3–5 Years Experience) – Interview Questions 🚀

For mid to senior-level Azure DevOps Engineers, these questions focus on real-world scenarios, architecture, security, and scalability 👇

🔹 Azure DevOps & CI/CD

1.How do Azure Pipelines work internally?
A.Azure Pipelines work by automatically building, testing, and deploying code through a sequence of defined stages using agents that execute pipeline tasks.

2.YAML vs Classic pipelines – when do you prefer each?
A.Use YAML pipelines for versioned, code-defined CI/CD with flexibility and reuse; use Classic pipelines for simpler, UI-driven setups or when YAML expertise isn’t available.

3.How do you design multi-stage pipelines in Azure DevOps?
A.Design multi-stage pipelines in Azure DevOps by defining sequential or parallel stages in YAML or Classic pipelines, each with jobs and steps, and controlling execution with dependencies and conditions.

4.How do you manage approvals and gates in release pipelines?
A.Manage approvals and gates in release pipelines by configuring pre-deployment and post-deployment approvals and gates that automatically validate conditions before proceeding.

5. Source Control & Artifacts
A. In Azure DevOps, Source Control manages your code using Git., while Artifacts store and share built outputs like npm, or Maven packages across pipelines and teams.

5. Azure Repos vs GitHub – key differences?
A.Azure Repos is a private, enterprise-focused Git repository integrated with Azure DevOps, while GitHub is a public/private Git platform with broader community collaboration and open-source focus.

6. How do you manage branching strategies in Azure Repos?
A.Manage branching strategies in Azure Repos by defining policies for feature, release, and main branches, using pull requests, branch protections, and merge strategies to control code flow.

7. How do you version and store build artifacts?
A. Version and store build artifacts by assigning unique version numbers and publishing them to Azure Artifacts, feed repositories, or external storage for reuse in deployments.

🔹 Azure Infrastructure
8. How do you design highly available applications in Azure?
A.Design highly available applications in Azure by distributing workloads across regions and availability zones, using load balancers, auto-scaling, and redundant services.

9. Difference between Availability Sets and Availability Zones?
A.Availability Sets protect VMs within a single datacenter from hardware failures, while Availability Zones replicate resources across separate datacenters for higher fault and region-level resilience.

10. When do you use Azure Load Balancer vs Application Gateway?
A.Use Azure Load Balancer for layer 4 traffic distribution and high-performance TCP/UDP load balancing, and Application Gateway for layer 7 traffic routing, SSL termination, and web application firewall capabilities.

🔹 Infrastructure as Code
11. ARM templates vs Bicep vs Terraform – what do you prefer and why?
A.ARM templates are JSON-based and native, Bicep is a simpler, declarative abstraction over ARM, and Terraform is cloud-agnostic; preference depends on Azure focus (Bicep/ARM) vs multi-cloud flexibility (Terraform).

12. How do you manage multiple environments using Terraform in Azure?
A.Manage multiple environments in Terraform by using workspaces, variable files, and environment-specific state configurations to isolate deployments per environment.

13. How do you handle Terraform remote state in Azure?
A.Handle Terraform remote state in Azure by storing it in Azure Storage accounts with container locks, optionally using Azure Cosmos DB or backend configurations for state management and concurrency control.

🔹 Containers & Kubernetes (AKS)
14. How does AKS handle scaling and self-healing?
A.AKS handles scaling with cluster and pod autoscalers and ensures self-healing by replacing failed nodes or restarting unhealthy pods automatically.

15. How do you deploy applications to AKS using Azure DevOps?
A.Deploy applications to AKS using Azure DevOps by creating CI/CD pipelines that build container images, push them to a registry, and apply Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts to the cluster.

16. How do you manage secrets in AKS?
A.Manage secrets in AKS using Kubernetes Secrets or integrating with Azure Key Vault for secure, centralized secret storage and access.

17. Difference between ConfigMaps and Secrets?
A.ConfigMaps store non-sensitive configuration data, while Secrets store sensitive information like passwords or keys, both accessible to pods in AKS.


🔹 Monitoring & Logging
18. How do Azure Monitor and Log Analytics work together?
19. How do you monitor AKS workloads?
20. How do you set up alerts for production issues?

🔹 Security & Governance
21. How do you secure Azure DevOps pipelines?
22. What is Azure Key Vault and how is it integrated with pipelines?
23. How do you implement RBAC in Azure?
24. How do you manage policies using Azure Policy?

🔹 Networking
25. Difference between VNet Peering and VPN Gateway?
26. How do you design secure networking for Azure workloads?

🔹 Real-World Scenarios
27. How do you handle zero-downtime deployments in Azure?
28. How do you troubleshoot failed Azure pipelines?
29. How do you manage cost optimization in Azure?
30. How do you migrate CI/CD pipelines from Jenkins to Azure DevOps?
