1.User reports random downtime in webapp hosted in Azure App Services?
A. To investigate random downtime in Azure App Service, I analyze App Service health, logs, and Azure Monitor metrics to identify CPU/memory pressure, app restarts, or platform events. I then use Application Insights to trace failures and address root causes like scaling, memory leaks, or dependency issues.
Hint: logs, manual to auto scale, threshold of cpu,mem - 90% redefined to 80% due to autoscale, Azure monitor metrics, app insights telemetry(metric & traces) 
2.How can you schedule a script to run everyday on Azure?
A. In Azure, 2 diff ways auto automation account (power shell)/azure function, python script with server less approach - az function, cleanup activity. If runback long time to run az automation - provide resource group  
3.Cannot SSH or RDP to an Azure VM, How will you fix it?
A. I’ll check VM status and NSG rules, port 22 open, window 3389 open, instances configured with public IP, VM is up and running due to resources. 
SSH keys user using, even authorize to do ssh.
I use Azure Network Watcher, reset credentials, or recover the VM using Serial Console or disk attach.
4.Azure Function failed to execute. How do you debug?
A. I will head to the application insights to check the logs to see then I will head to function timeout. Users configure less timeout such as five seconds, 10s and occasionally function takes a lot of time. I will ask the developer, I will also look at memory limit because function consumes more memory. I will take the help from the development team why function is occasionally taking more memory than the configured threshold. So I will try to check the environment variables as well as the keys. Finally,  Azure Functions it also supports live metrics. So I will take a look at live metrics by performing a test run. 
5.How will you restrict access to a storage account so only VM’s in specific VNet.
A. Hint: console ->virtual network -> endpoint (service endpoint and private endpoints), click add search Microsoft Storage -> click on the default subnet. Then  storage account -> networks -> restrict it to selected Vnets and also certain IP addresses.
6.Your team wants to replicate a production SQL database to staging daily. What’s
A. Hint: I will head to Azure Data Factory.I will create a pipeline that can copy the data between the SQL instances if required. I will also schedule a trigger such as a nightly trigger.
So if Azure Data Factory does not support such pipeline, then you might have to do it manually in on premise.
7.How do you use tags on the resources in Azure? Do you enforce them?
A.resource group for the orgs in the organization or we have for sub organizations in the organization, whereas we have tags for specific projects in the organization. 
Hint: Policy -> compliance -> policy with tags
8.How do you create resources on Azure? Bicep or ARM or Terraform?
A. I can build Terraform infrastructure with modules. I have worked with Terraform Workspaces and the code is completely reusable.
I create Azure resources using Infrastructure as Code. For Azure-native deployments, I prefer Bicep for its clean syntax and modularity, or ARM templates for legacy support. For multi-cloud or large-scale automation, I use Terraform.
9.Your team has access to delete resources. How do you prevent accidental deletion?
To prevent accidental deletion, I use Azure Resource Locks (CanNotDelete), enforce least-privilege RBAC, apply Azure Policies to deny delete operations, and implement approval workflows for destructive actions. Additionally, I enable monitoring and soft-delete for recovery.
And this is possible at the subscription level.
You can do it at the resource group level.And you can also do it at the resource level.Whether it is subscription, whether it is resource, group or resource.You can apply a resource lock for it and you can set as cannot delete.Now when you do it except the Administrator.No one can actually delete the resources.You can also set the lock to not modifiable.So even if someone tries to modify a production instance they cannot modify it.It can be a database.It can be a virtual machine or it can be any production instance.Just head to Azure and set up logs.
make sure a proper Rbac is setup.So in Azure I can set up readers, I can set up contributor and I can set up owner.I will set up resource locks on the production instance.Lock your Azure resources to prevent your infrastructure.Protect your infrastructure.So as I told you, cannot delete read only lock inheritance where you can set up locks at the subscriptionso that all the resources within the subscription resource groups can inherit that policy.   
10.In AKS cluster how will you secure app to app communication. Or  what is mutual TLS? Or have you implemented mutual TLS in your Kubernetes cluster? Or what is service mesh? Or How do you use service mesh in your Kubernetes cluster?
A.First thing to secure pod to pod communication. You can set up mutual TLS using service mesh (Istio) Or using application Gateway as well you can configure mutual TLS.
Then for pod to pod communication you can also use something called as network policies in Kubernetes.
For example you want to restrict a database in Kubernetes.  only two microservices within a particular namespace to access the database rest.
If they try to access the database, the access should be restricted.This can be done using network policies in Kubernetes.So you just define some labels on the database.And you know that labels only allows the request from certain pods.You have to create a resource called network policy.
So one you can implement pod to pod secure communication using mutual TLS where you can talk about Istio. Second, you can talk about network policies.
So you will set up Istio where Istio setups a sidecar container using mutating webhook.And this mutating webhook creates a sidecar container which is envoy proxy.And this envoy proxy takes care of secure communication between the pods.
When it comes to network policy, this is just a Kubernetes resource.Just like kind deployment, you create a kind network policy and you define some labels, which only allows traffic to the pods from certain pods, or traffic to DB from certain pods.
11.Explain how to connect Azure VM’s to a database that is on-premises ? or Azure VPN gateway? Or  how to connect Azure resources to some of the services that you have on premises. Or How can you set up this tunnel for virtual machines to route the request through the tunnel. And the request reads the database in a secure way. 
A. I will create a virtual network gateway in Azure. And I will associate this virtual network gateway with a public IP. And then I will associate this with a subnet obviously. And I will head to my on premises within my on premises environment.
I will ask my firewall on networking team to configure a VPN device. And within this VPN device, something like Cisco or Fortinet.  I will ask the networking team, or maybe the firewall team, to match the settings of the VPN device with the Azure Virtual Network settings. So this is where they will create a IPsec tunnel. And then I will establish a site to site connectivity, which is very simple.
I will define a local network in the Azure platform. And then I will try to connect the Azure VPN gateway with the VPN device on on premises. So this is how I will establish a site to site connectivity. So I will integrate the VPN gateway with the VPN device on on premises. And then I will just run some Azure CLI commands to verify the connectivity. So this is how I will establish the connectivity between Azure Virtual Network and on premises.
Hint:  IPsec tunnel or Vxlan tunnel. In a nutshell, I will use VPN Gateway on Azure an I will install and configure a VPN device on premises. Between these devices, I will establish a IPsec tunnel that is using site to site connectivity. So on the VPN device, I will match the configuration of the VPN gateway on the Azure platform.So this way a secure connection is established.
12.How do you ensure data redundancy and performance in multi-region deployment.
A. multi-region deployment there is one service provided by Azure - > Azure front door acts as a global load balancer.Azure Traffic Manager is also there But let's restrict to Azure front door
I will be using Azure Front Door service, which can perform the routing request depending on latency. And it also acts as a global load balancer.  So performance is handled by front door, whereas when it comes to the data redundancy you will enable geo replication on Azure SQL database.
13.A VM based application in East US is slow for users in Europe. What do you do?
A.I will evaluate multi-region deployment instead of a single region deployment.Then I will see if load balancing is still required within a particular region.If the load balancing is required within a particular region, that's totally fine.I will configure the load balancing.Then I will use the Azure Front door service to implement a global load balancer.I will also enable web Application firewall and SSL offloading at the Azure front door, so that I can introduce enhanced security to the platform.Finally, I will ensure that Azure front door or I will cross check Azure front door forwards the request
to the right region by calculating the latency.It will do this by default, but still I will just do a double check.
 I will also enable web Application firewall and SSL offloading at the Azure front door, so that I can introduce enhanced security to the platform.
14.Service principals vs Managed Identities, which on is better?
need authentication and authorization is actually served by service principals and managed identities in Azure. Azure service principles and managed identities are both used for authentication and authorization to the Azure resources to access the Azure resources, but they differ in how they are managed and their scope. Service principle requires manual creation and management of credentials. It can be created by app registration in Active Directory, whereas managed identities are created when the resources are created on the Azure platform.
You will configure this managed identity and grant permissions to a particular resource in the managed identity, so that your virtual machine can connect to the blob. managed identities are better but if it is an external resource have to go for a service principle.
15.Explain how did you use NSG and ASG in realtime?
In real-time, I used NSGs to control inbound/outbound traffic at subnet and VM levels, and ASGs to group application tiers logically. This allowed scalable, maintainable, and secure network policies for multi-tier Azure applications without hardcoding IP addresses.
Hint: Both NSG and ASG help control traffic in Azure Virtual Network. NSG defines the rules whereas ASG groups the resources.
